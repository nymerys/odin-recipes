        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Taiwanese Lu Rou Fan is a traditional dish made from braising pork belly in a mixture of many fragrant spices, served over rice and accompanied by vegetables, ginger, eggs, and tofu. It is one of the most beloved traditional Taiwanese dishes in the country, bested perhaps only by the national dish of Taiwanese beef noodle soup. Though there was controversy over whether the dish originated from Taiwan or China, the Taiwanese government launched a campaign providing 1000 free bowls of the food to claim ownership of the dish's creation.</p>
        <h2>Spices</h2>
            <p>Lu Rou Fan incorporates a plethora of different spices, usually depending on region or personal recipes. However, almost every Taiwanese connessieur would agree that Lu Rou Fan's trademark flavor cannot be achieved without these key spices:</p>
        <h3>Star Anise</h3>

                <p>Star anise is perhaps the most important ingredient in Lu Rou Fan. Its potent and distinct flavor penetrates the mixture of all other spices, distinguishing the dish from other Asian cuisines. It is one of the defining flavors for Taiwan.</p>
        <h3>Soy Sauce</h3>

                <p>Soy sauce is a staple ingredient in many Asian cuisines, and Taiwanese cuisine is no exception. Soy sauce will be the main, if not sole, source of the saltiness that serves as the base flavor of Lu Rou Fan.</p>
        <h3>Rice Wine</h3>

                <p>Rice wine will bring about the fresh aroma of the pork belly and other spices. It grounds the flavor of the dish. Though many use Shaoxing wine, I prefer using cooking rice wine.</p>
        <h3>Water</h3>

                <p>Water! It is the key ingredient for braising food. Since this dish is typically braised for one and a half to two hours, we need plenty of water to allow the meat to tenderize and absorb the necessary flavors.</p>
        <h3>Sugar</h3>

                <p>Taiwanese dishes often like to incorporate both salty and sweet flavors. Thus, sugar is usually added to Lu Rou Fan to sweeten the dish. I personally use brown sugar for health reasons, but any type of sugar can work. Rock sugar is best to generate the shiny gloss that coats the meat.</p>
        
        <h2>Process</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The first step is to dice the pork belly. Be sure to buy good quality pork belly with a good fat to meat ratio. Dice the pork belly into small pieces, with each piece having both fat and meat. Smaller pieces will cook faster; larger ones will take longer.
                    <p><img src="https://meatsellers.com/cdn/shop/products/IMG_4537_1024x1024.jpg?v=1634870906" alt="An image of fatty pork belly diced into small pieces." height="200" width="300"></p>
                </li>
                <li>Next, heat up a large wok or pan. Make sure it is large enough to contain all the diced pork and liquids. Turn the heat to medium-high, then add a little bit of oil. You do not need to add too much, as the fat from the pork belly will appropriately grease the rest of the pan. I personally use any oil at hand, usually canola oil.
                    <p><img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/186768677/photo/pouring-eating-oil-in-frying-pan.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=Eo_Gj0fs1XErqTGWgIzd-8yYm20dSwjMqKv2BYH2AuE=" alt="An image of a pan lightly oiled." height="200" width="300"></p>
                </li>
                <li>Once the pan is hot and oiled, place the diced pork belly into the pan. Be careful of the oil splashes. We will lightly sauteé the pork, just to sear the outsides a little bit. Some recipes ask to add a small portion of the spices at this stage, which will allow the flavors to directly penetrate the meat. You may choose to do so if you wish.

                </li>
                <li>Next, we will add all the spices. Put in the soy sauce, rice wine, water, sugar, and star anise. You may add chili oil or other spices to give this dish a little kick if you wish. Make sure the liquids completely cover the pork belly, as we will be braising the food for a long time.

                </li>
                <li>Stir and cover the pot. Turn the heat to medium-low, and braise for one and a half hours or until the pork is tender. Lowering the temperature and keeping the lid on the pot will allow the meat to soften and tender at a steady rate without breaking the fibers and ruining the texture of the meat. Keep checking on it every half an hour. Once the pork is at the desired consistency, turn of the stove and serve with rice. Enjoy!
