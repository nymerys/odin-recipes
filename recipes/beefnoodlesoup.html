        <h1>Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup is arguably the country's most recognizable signature dish. It is the national dish of Taiwan, and is featured in all areas of media, official merchandise, and can be found at every corner of the country.</p>
        <h2>Spices</h2>
            <p>The following ingredients are required to achieve the trademark balance of salty and sweet found in Taiwanese cuisine.</p>
        <h3>Soy Sauce</h3>

            <p>This is what creates the saltiness.</p>
        <h3>Rice Wine</h3>

            <p>This will bring out the fragrances of the other flavors.</p>
        <h3>Sugar</h3>

            <p>Taiwanese dishes often like to incorporate both salty and sweet flavors. Thus, sugar is usually added to Lu Rou Fan to sweeten the dish. I personally use brown sugar for health reasons, but any type of sugar can work. Rock sugar is best to generate the shiny gloss that coats the meat.</p>
        <h3>Star Anise</h3>

            <p>Star anise is perhaps the most important ingredient in Lu Rou Fan. Its potent and distinct flavor penetrates the mixture of all other spices, distinguishing the dish from other Asian cuisines. It is one of the defining flavors for Taiwan.</p>
        <h3>Bay Leaf</h3>

            <p>Bay leaves will round out the flavors.</p>
